            <p class="web-dev-texts">
              First I've never wondered about anything about web
              development.I've started my coding journey with C programming and
              little bit C++.My love for programming started there.Then I've
              started watching coding related videos.Then I have known about Web
              development.Then I wondered how it is to be done!!.Then i've
              started a little research on that.I have learn to inspect a web
              browser.I just got facinated by the works of others an their web
              page.Then I've started HTML and little bit of CSS.I hope to
              achieve many things from programming hero.
